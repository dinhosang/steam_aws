#   PURPOSE:
#       -   not everything can be setup as part of the packer build
#       -   this sets up a controller script which handles the running of the various startup scripts
#       -   the controller script will also be updated by the other startup scripts
#           -   this is how it is made aware of startup scripts other than itself (the controller)
#       -   the resulting controller script would them be run at startup via the aws cli user-data
#       -   NOTE: keep in mind that it takes a little while at instance startup for the scripts to be run
